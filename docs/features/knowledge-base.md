# Knowledge Base

!!! warning "Coming Soon"
    The Knowledge Base feature is currently in development and not yet available in the beta release.

## Planned Features

The Knowledge Base will provide persistent context about your projects across conversations:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-file-document-multiple:{ .lg .middle } **Project Context**

    ---

    Store information about your codebase structure, conventions, and patterns that persists across chat sessions.

-   :material-magnify:{ .lg .middle } **Semantic Search**

    ---

    Automatically retrieve relevant context when you ask questions about your project.

-   :material-tag-multiple:{ .lg .middle } **Organization**

    ---

    Tag and categorize knowledge entries for easy retrieval and management.

-   :material-sync:{ .lg .middle } **Auto-Updates**

    ---

    Keep your knowledge base in sync with your evolving codebase.

</div>

## Current Alternatives

While the Knowledge Base is in development, you can achieve similar results with:

### Project Descriptions

Add context about your project in **Settings** → **General** → **Project Description**. This information is included in every conversation.

### File Attachments

Attach relevant files to your conversations using the file browser sidebar. Fabric will use these files as context for your questions.

### Conversation History

Your chat history is preserved and searchable. Use the History panel in the sidebar to find and reopen previous conversations.

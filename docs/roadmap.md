# Roadmap

**Where Fabric is headed—and why it matters for your workflow.**

We're building the AI coding assistant we always wanted: fast enough for daily use, smart enough for complex problems, and transparent enough that you always know what's happening.

## Coming Soon

### :material-link-variant: Deep Codebase Understanding

**The Problem:** Current AI tools treat your code like random text. They don't understand how your files connect, which functions call which, or where your patterns live.

**What We're Building:** Graph-based code analysis that maps the relationships in your codebase. When you ask "where do we validate user input?", Fabric will trace the actual data flow—not just grep for keywords.

---

### :material-auto-fix: Smarter Auto-Apply

**The Problem:** AI suggests code changes, but applying them is manual and error-prone. Copy, paste, hope you got the right spot.

**What We're Building:** One-click apply with intelligent diffing. Fabric shows exactly what will change, handles merge conflicts gracefully, and lets you undo anything.

---

### :material-robot-outline: Persistent Agents

**The Problem:** Complex tasks require multiple steps, but current AI forgets context between messages. You end up re-explaining your codebase over and over.

**What We're Building:** Long-running agents that remember what they've learned about your project. Start a refactoring task, come back tomorrow, and pick up exactly where you left off.

---

### :material-database-search: Database-Aware SQL

**The Problem:** Writing SQL without seeing your schema is like coding blindfolded. AI generates queries that look right but reference wrong tables.

**What We're Building:** Connect your database and Fabric knows your schema. It suggests columns that actually exist, joins that actually work, and queries optimized for your data.

---

### :material-source-branch: Git-Native Workflows

**The Problem:** AI helps you write code, but the commit-PR-review cycle is still manual. Context gets lost between "write this feature" and "ship it."

**What We're Building:** Integrated version control that helps you commit with meaningful messages, create PRs with proper descriptions, and track what AI contributed to each change.

---

## Recently Shipped

### :material-eye: Transparent Reasoning

See the AI think through problems step-by-step. No more black boxes—understand *why* it suggests what it suggests.

### :material-swap-horizontal: Multi-Model Selection

Choose the right model for each task. Fast models for quick questions, powerful ones for complex reasoning.

### :material-tab: Chat Groups

Organize related conversations. Keep your "Auth Rewrite" separate from your "Sprint Bugs."

### :material-shield-check: Approval Workflow

Every file change requires your OK. Full audit trail of AI actions.

!!! quote "Our Philosophy"
    **Velocity without blindness.** Ship faster, but always know what's happening. That's the future we're building.
